An error was raised when the CDS fa files from each genome were made, I looked online and the gffread program I am using has unfixed bug reports with similar issues so I assume that this is just a bug and needs to be worked around. The error was as follows:
...making CDS fa using 2006 genome
Error (GFaSeqGet): end coordinate (86668) cannot be larger than sequence length 86667  # for Twi7.2
Error (GFaSeqGet): end coordinate (86668) cannot be larger than sequence length 86667
Error (GFaSeqGet): end coordinate (177921) cannot be larger than sequence length 177920  # for _Twi7.2a
Error (GFaSeqGet): end coordinate (177921) cannot be larger than sequence length 177920

...making CDS fa using 2014 genome
Error (GFaSeqGet): end coordinate (86668) cannot be larger than sequence length 86667
Error (GFaSeqGet): end coordinate (86668) cannot be larger than sequence length 86667

This shouldn't be an issue for the sequence length should be 3224bp for Twi7.2 and 850bp for Twi7.2a. To work around this the end coordinate for "Twi7.2:Plus_Strand:Low-copy_repeat" and "Twi7.2:Minus_Strand:Low-copy_repeat" was changed from 86668 to 86667 (1nt) as this did not trigger the error. Also, the end coordinate for "_Twi7.2a:Plus_Strand:Low-copy_repeat" and "_Twi7.2a:Minus_Strand:Low-copy_repeat" was changed from 177921 to 177920. 
Finally, I opened up the CDS files and checked that the sequences were the correct lengths and they were, issue resolved.
